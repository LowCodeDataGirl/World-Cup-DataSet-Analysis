/*
Do any teams seem to be stronger in either the first half or the second half? (think about both offense and defense)
 I had to create a CTE to create the table with the tables i needed to answer this question.
The name of the CTE is HalfTimeGoals and I got the 2nd half goals by subtracting Home team goals and 1st half goals
